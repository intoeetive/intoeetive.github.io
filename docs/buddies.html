	<h1>Buddies</h1>

	<p>This module enables users to have buddies/friends/followers just like in many popular social networks and blogging systems.</p>
    <p>The users are able to add/remove others as their friends. The lists of friends added by user and also who added him can be displayed.</p>
    <p>Also, you can have “enemies” along with friends - for fun or for something useful.</p>
<p>The module is using standard database table, so it’s 100% compatible with Buddies/Blocked list that can be found under Personal messages in user’s Control Panel.</p>
